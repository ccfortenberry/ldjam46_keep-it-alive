# Ludum Dare 46 | Keep It Alive
When the theme came out as 'Keep It Alive' my immediate instinct was to make a bootleg Touhou game. Lacking in both time and expertise, I figured the next best thing was to try and create a survival-style platformer.

You are a Droplet name Meringue, and for whatever reason you're being haunted by the crude Phantom. The goal is simple: stay alive. Your health ticks down over time and the Phantom has spikes and bullets to make sure the clock moves a little faster, so to speak. You're not without help as every once in a while a peach will appear to give you some health back (which happens to be a favorite food of the Droplets). How long can you keep the Droplet alive?
